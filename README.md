> A Vampire Survival Experience

> Awaken as a weakened vampire after centuries of slumber. Hunt for blood to regain your strength while hiding from the scorching sun to survive. Rebuild your castle and convert humans into your loyal servants in a quest to raise your vampire empire. Make allies or enemies online or play solo locally, fend off holy soldiers, and wage war in a world of conflict.

> Will you become the next Dracula?


> A Gothic Open-World

>Explore a vast world teeming with mythical horrors and danger. Travel through lush forests, open countryside, and dark caverns to discover valuable resources, meeting friends and foes alike along the way. Traverse the world with vampire comrades or hunt solo as you pillage villages, raid bandits, and delve into the domains of supernatural beasts.

> Fear the light - Rule the night

> Stick to the shadows during the daytime, or the burning sunlight will turn you to ashes. Roam the night and prey on your victims in the darkness. As a vampire, you must quench your thirst for blood while planning your strategies around the day and nighttime.

> Raise your Castle

> Gather resources and discover ancient techniques to gain dark powers. Use your newly acquired knowledge to build a castle where you can store your loot and grow your army of darkness. Personalize your domain, exhibit your vampiric style and make sure to craft coffins for servants and friends. Strengthen your castle to protect your treasure hoard from vampire rivals.

> Compete or Cooperate

> Travel alone or explore the world with friends. Fighting side by side with other vampires will give you an advantage in the fight to conquer the greatest threats of Vardoran. Raid other players’ castles or play the diplomat in the game of blood, power, and betrayal. Compete or cooperate - the choice is yours

> Master your Vampire

> Learn and master an arsenal of deadly weapons and unholy abilities. In V Rising, you aim skill-shots and dodge projectiles using​ precise​​ ​WASD controls ​and cursor-based​ ​aiming - no click to move. Tailor your vampire to fit your play style by combining weapons with a variety of spells earned through vanquishing powerful foes. Master your skills and unleash your wicked powers.

Rebought the game. Decided it doesn't matter if I don't have anyone to play with.

My base got destroyed.. again. Time to start again on a new solo world. There is the possibility of pandy and them making a server.


Like ablion online.

Slow starting off even solo with all the resources.

Just got the Alpha Wolf blood. 

Building my base. I have the starter stuff. Following the tutorial. It lets you roam free and if you get stuff you can just finish with the "process". 


There is a bit of a free gap in 'the progress'. Collecting copper, gotta get animal hide, need paper. Basics.
